## Initialize and Select Scene

To run the program, open my project with Unity. Then make sure to only have the "Select" scene loaded first for the scene selection program to work

![How to Init](https://github.com/TimChenyu/ARVR-README/blob/main/arvr%20pics/HT%20-%20Init.png)
Then press play, to enter the program
There is a button on the bottom right corner of the scene to navigate back to the selection screen.
Please make sure all other scene are not loaded and ONLY the selection scene is loaded to make this program work.


## Problem 1
For problem 1, there are 2 sliders c1 and c2 to control the variables that control the level of distortion to the fragment shader

## Problem 2
For problem 2, there are 6 sliders to control the amount of offset the level of Lateral Chromatic Aberration

## Problem 3
For problem 3, there are 2 sliders c1 and c2 to control the variables that control the level of distortion applied to the vertex shader

## Problem Inverse
To apply the inverse, there is a toggle in the inspector that can apply the inverse for all 3 complex meshes for problem 3

## Bugs
In case the sliders dont show up, the variables can also be changed in the inspector, but you would have to exit play mode and then load the first scene again go navigate through the scenes.
